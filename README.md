# No code web builder frontend

Have implemented a basic rendering system for html as well as user-defined nodes, that takes in a sample ast (the same is consumed by the backend) and renders the tree to the screen

It now supports state management and effects.

## Todos:

- [ ] Better id tracking
- [x] basic tree manipulation
- [x] Add/Wrap the nodes with dnd logic
