# No code web builder frontend

Have implemented a basic rendering system for html as well as user-defined nodes, that takes in a sample ast (the same is consumed by the backend) and renders the tree to the screen

It now supports state management and effects.

The static renderer and ast structure look stable and extensible now, with a sample ast structure as init to the state, can be used to get an idea of types, till I add types in here...

## Todos:

- [ ] Better id tracking
- [x] basic tree manipulation
- [x] Add/Wrap the nodes with dnd logic
